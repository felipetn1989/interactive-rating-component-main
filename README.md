## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the use of "+" and "~" operators in CSS to target siblings. In this project, I wanted to change the color of the label associated with the selected radio only, so "+" was the appropriate operator. If I used "~" it would select all the labels after the selected radio and not only the one associated with it.
